## We need a better media server

With Plex recently adding "features" nobody asked for, wanted, or uses, being more bloated than ever before, and still not implementing long-awaited[^1] features, we need a new media server.

Kirino Media Server aims to be a free, open source, lightweight, modular, better Plex replacement.

## Features
 - No cloud!
 - Super lightweight
   - KMS can run comfortably on a Raspberry Pi[^2]
 - Completely modular

### Planned
 - Transcoding w/ ffmpeg
 - Hub: a server you can run to easily share your media collection

[^2]: Your results may vary. Transcoding requires a more powerful machine.
